## Submission Instructions

### Overview
With the personal and economic impact of the ongoing global pandemic, many have turned to safer alternatives to earning additional income. A friend has done exactly that by selling baked goods and beverages off of his Instagram story. He is currently taking orders through direct messages (DM), manually updating his story every time an item sells out, and referencing hand written notes for the orders and what is owed by who.
I would like to make his life easier and more orderly by creating an e-commerce app. Instead of ordering through DMs, his customers would be able to do some, if not all, of the following: order through the app where they are able to login, see what items are available (depending on admin-controlled inventory), add items to cart, select payment method, select a pick up time, and receive an order confirmation upon admin approval. This would be beneficial for both the users and admin by having a database to reference for all components of the business versus scrolling through messages. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create a password protected account and login to the application. Each user will be able to receive a unique order confirmation number if an order is placed and approved by the admin.
Create items: Admin will be able to exclusively produce a user-viewable inventory of items for sale. The inventory will update as orders are confirmed.
Purchasing power: Users will be able to add items to cart, select a payment method, and submit their order for admin approval - upon which user will receive an order confirmation.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Iâ€™ll need to learn how to:
Use inputs of an admin populated form in a presentable manner for users
Ensure the admin is the only party able to modify inventory and approve order
Auto-generate order confirmations triggered by admin approval
Optimize the app for mobile use
